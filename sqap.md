## 1 - Concept of Operations

Purpose: This document outlines plans the SQA Squad has to ensure quality assurance for the product ensuring the requirements from the Contract and compliance to standards in '730-2014 - IEEE Standard for Software Quality Assurance Processes' are followed

Scope: We want to create a product that assists farmers in tracking their feed and lifestock, how much is essential or required. It will allow them to compare to livestock or herds in their area and around the world. 

## 2 - Definitions and Acronyms

### Key terms and definitions:
* Compliance - Doing what has been asked or ordered; as required by rule or law.
* Contract - A binding agreement between two parties, especially enforceable by law, or a similar internal agreement wholly within an organization [ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2008]. A contract is an agreement between two or more parties regarding a course of action. The formality of a contract can range from a simple informal oral description to a formal written instrument. This standard calls an agreement between software acquirer and supplier a contract.
* Product - The result of a process; an artifact that is produced, is quantifiable, and can be either an end item in itself or a component item (PMBOKÂ® Guide [B48]). Includes intermediate as well as end-item artifacts; complete set of software and documentation; output of software development activities.
